### What it Does
This app will notify you when you have been sitting too long. The motion processor in your phone allows this app to monitor your activity in the background without affecting battery life.

Studies show that sitting for extended periods can be as dangerous as smoking!

PLEASE NOTE: This phone *requires* the Nokia SensorCore functionality. This chip is only some phones including the Nokia Lumia 1520/930/635 and Lumia Icon.
Added configurable amount of time before notifying you to move.
